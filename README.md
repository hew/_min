# _min

 A rapid styling system built on `Hyperapp`.

# Project Goals


- ‚úç Write component styles inline (with shorthand properties) ([API](http://github.com/jxnblk/understyle.))
- ‚éÄ Convert those styles to actual classnames ([API](http://github.com/jxnblk/cxs))
- Ôπñ All extracted out to a separate stylesheet (üòÖ)
- ‚åÅ Use a super lightweight non-React microframework. ([API](http://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp)))

## The Basic Idea

Build layouts like this.

```js
<Box 
  flex 
  px2 py2 
  items-center 
  black bgBlue
  >
  Hummus
</Box>
```

Or like this:

```js
const style = {
  maxWidth: '74em',
  margin: '0 auto'
}

<Box css={style}>...</Box>
```

And depending on your config...

```
export const classNameOutput = 'lite' // lite, atomic, monolithic
```


...get classnames like this: 

```js
// lite
// a b c i j k l

// atomic  
// d-flex pl-16 pr-16 pt-16 pb-16 c-374047 bc-0077cc

// monolithic
// _kzfwue
```


## FAQs

### Can this handle responsive styles?

Yes. Even shorthands. [See API](https://github.com/jxnblk/understyle#responsive-styles)

### Does this work with `React`?

Not out of the box, but it could be adapted pretty easily.

### Performance Concerns

Under the hood `_min` uses `cxs`, which [holds up well in tests](https://engineering.hellofresh.com/the-css-in-js-battle-89c34a7a83ea). Regardless, 
I see this type of approach being used more for prototyping, designing, and small websites.
 

## Current/Future Goals

Figure out a way to get all the styles extracted into a separate stylesheet, so
as to eliminate any performance concerns, and Make Alex Happy‚Ñ¢.
